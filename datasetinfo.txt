There are two datasets provided:
(1) monthly_detections_frontex.csv
(2) processed_data_frontex.csv

(1)

Target data. Contains monthly border detections at different Route borders.

Navigate to this link for more information in general about Frontex and the dataset, check out the tab 'Migratory Routes' minimally:
https://www.frontex.europa.eu/what-we-do/monitoring-and-risk-analysis/monitoring-and-risk-analysis/

Nature of dataset:
Our ultimate target is an aggregated monthly prediction by Route (Eastern Mediterranean Route, etc.).


(2)

Exogenous variables. Contains various data sources about all countries that appear at least once in the target dataset.

Various country metrics, and then I collected and added: 
- commodity price/stock_close: because we are talking about movements people are making, I thought including some information about current trading prices/stock prices would be possibly useful.
